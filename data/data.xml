<!--
  **This is your company page**. It should not focus on a specific product, but present your whole company. The journalists won't, most of the time, know you or your studio. With this page, you will have an opportunity to show your people, your work, your history and your contributions in a standard format. This is not a replacement for your website, but a quick way for the press to know you faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t company
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  Okay… ready? Let's do this.

  <hr>

  For your products' `data.xml`, [refer to the product documentation](../product/).

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<company>` tag for your main `data.xml` file. **It will be the root page of your presskit.**

    Tell your story with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<histories>` block like in the example.
    - Or use a single `<history>` block if you don't have much to say.

    You can't have both.

    Example of a single block:

    ```xml
    <history>
      Hello, world.
    </history>
    ```
  -->
  <histories>
    <history>
      <header>Long road</header>
      <text>Erick Quijivix started making games at the age of 16 doing small clones of Pokemon games on javascript, and megaman clones with visual basic. After studying computer science and working on web development, Erick switched careers to music, studying jazz performance. After studying and moving to Uruguay, he came back to make games on 2016, creating several small jam games while honing his skills in pixel art and game design. </text>

    <history>
      <header>From Jam games to Award winning game</header>
      <text>After several years of making small games, after entering a game jam (as usual) Erick found a game that sparked his current game on development, The Black Pepper Crew. 2 years later, the game won the Uruguayan Debut game award on 2021.</text>

    This is for your people.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your **frequent** collaborators for example.

    If a collaborator has only worked on one product, add her/him on this product page instead.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
